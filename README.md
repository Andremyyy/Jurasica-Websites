# Jurasica-Websites
A collaborative project to develop 35 web pages for Jurasica Adventure Park in Neptun, using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Each page showcased a dinosaur exhibit with a brief description, multiple images, and bilingual (Romanian/English) audio narration. The pages were accessible via QR codes placed at the exhibits, enhancing visitor engagement.
